Running Container commands with Docker:

--> docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash 
--> docker ps ( For Ex: we get image elastic_yamia )
--> # ps (get the information of the container)
      top (Lists all the load of the system)

--> cd /root
--> ls -al
--> which sshd & which telnet (Noting will be there)

want to see the logs of that images we can find it by

--> docker logs elastic_yamia (shows what hpn still Now)

For Example:  I don't to attach the container but should running in the background, what is the command

--> docker exec elastic_yamia /bin/cat /etc/profile
--> docker attach elastic_yamia 

In the container # -->If we change anything like in the --> vim /etc/profile

# --> apt-get install vim
--> apt-get update
--> :wq
--> exit

--> docker ps -a

--> Restart the container --> docker restart elastic_yamia
--> docker exec elastic_yamia /bin/cat /etc/profile
--> we can see the change that we made for the /etc/profile

--> docker stop elastic_yamia

Other example:

If we want to exectue the command in deamon:

-->docker run -d ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash -c "while true;do echo HELLO;sleep 1; done"
--> docker ps
--> docker logs silly_kilby

If we want to see that how many times its running we can look by using the command

--> docker ps
--> docker logs silly_kilby | WC -l
--> docker stop silly_kilby

Exposing our container with port Redirects:

--> docker pull nginx:latest

connect to nginx, in the background

--> docker run -d nginx:latest
--> docker inspect peaceful:Almartie
--> elinks
--> sudo yum install elinks

After installing elinks with the IP address given in the Inspect image we can see the 

--> elinks http://172.17.0.2 (we can look the IP Address in the inspect image) Here we can see the Nginx webpage
--> elinks http://loaclhost (It won't work)

How to get the nginx webpage to losthost by using the below commands first stop the container and run the command:

--> docker stop peaceful:Almertia
--> docker run -d -P 80:80 nginx:latest
--> docker ps (can see container running)
--> elinks http://172.17.0.2 (we can see the webpage)
--> elinks http://localhost 

The other example is 

--> docker run -d -P 8080:80 nginx:latest
--> docker ps
--> docker logs determined_nother
--> elinks http://172.17.0.2 (we can see the web page)
--> elinks http://localhost (we can't see the nginx page)
--> elinks http://localhost:8080 (Now we can see the page in the nginx)
