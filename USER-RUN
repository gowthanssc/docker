User and Run Directives should be in the order of Execution you can use the below examples

For Example: 

root @ # --> mkdir Builds
--> cd Builds
--> Vim Dockerfile

	# Docker file based onthe latest centos7 image-non-privilized user entry
	FROM centos:latest
	MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com
	RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash
	USER user

--> docker build -t centos7/nonroot:v1 . 
--> docker run -it centos7/nonroot:v1 /bin/bash  ( this will attach to the container which is build for the Docker file)

--> docker exec -u 0 -it sleep_allen /bin/bash (It will attach to that particular container with the root user but not the user we created in the Docker file)


For Example if we want to add any RUN for the above Docker file

EXample : In order to run it should not be in the below order

# Dockerfile based on the latest centos7 image - non -privileged user entry
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user

USER user

RUN echo "EXPORT 192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/exports.list


For the Above the build fails because the order of execution is not correct after RUN we has to get USER.( Entrypoint)

It has to be like below :

# Dockerfile based on the latest centos7 image - non -privileged user entry
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user
RUN echo "EXPORT 192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/exports.list

USER user
