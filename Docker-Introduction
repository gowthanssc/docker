Docker-Introduction:

--> Isolate Applications
--> Open source
--> Automates deployments
--> Build Easy.
--> Configuration simplification ( can share the tar file in organization)
--> Enhance Developer productivity.
--> Server consolidation and Management (Virtulization with better resources)
--> Application Isolation
--> Rapid deployments ( Very quickly deploy large applications)
--> Build Management (large complex Build Easily)

Virtual Machine:

--> Emulation of specific computer system type.(i.e Runs's other O.s for Hardware A & Run software B on Hardware A)
--> Windows on Linux
--> Linux on windows.
--> Virtualiztion software setup one Operating system to another O.s
--> Communication from one O.S to Another O.s will be done through Hypervisor.

Container ?

--> Set of packages/liberies for the application to Run. 
--> The application runs in its own space. 

Important ?

--> Protection, Memory usage, Diskspace.
--> Built Environments, used to control the traffic with customers.
--> Also the virulazation can switch the environments.
--> Containers can share Operating systems.

container Architecture :

--> It is a Client-server Application.
-->Both daemon & Client can run on the Same system or You can connect Docker client & Daemon to the remote Client.
--> You can connect Docker Daemon & Client via Sockets.

The main components:

--> Daemon.
--> Client
--> Registry.

Y we used this is to save memory, Disk utillization.

Hasn't this already done ?

--> Free BSD -Jails.
--> Sun (oracle)Solaries -Zones.
--> Google - lmctfy(Let me contain it for you)
--> open VZ

All this companies adopt docker.

Docker Hub:

--> Can find n number of images. Can be available free for a single repository. We can also pull images from that DockerHub.

--> Basically after creating an DockerHub account we can get a single private repository for free. we can Explore repositories and see all the images in this. nginx (used for high traffic).
