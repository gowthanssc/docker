Volumes:

--> We can share the directory and files with in the volumes and the Host, even if we create a new file in the Host Directory, we get the same change in the volumes in the container itself.

we can make the changes and create the files in the Host directory For Example: appl.bin,config.local, message.txt each and every change will be replicated to the Container itself.
