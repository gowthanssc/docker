RUN & CMD differences:

RUN: Actually does the build process, and dockerfile to restart the process. It creates a layer that creates a base image that the docker file is intended to build.

CMD: Similar to RUN, However Execuate to use a specific command but it is not extended during the build.
	What is does it sets up a command to be RUN when the container is INSTATIANG of the image that we just build. it is a default command that is executed in the creation of those containers, that are based on the image.


CMD: Default, RUN : Is a base image.

For example: 

root @ # --> mkdir Echoserver
	--> cd EchoServer
	--> cp ../RunAsUser/Dockerfile .
	--> vim Dockerfile


# Dockerfile based on the latest centos7 image - non -privileged user entry
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user

CMD "echo" "This is a custom container message for our Naveen Dasari Class"

USER user


--> docker build -t centos7/echo:v1
--> docker run centos7/echo:v1 (Here we are running the CMD but not all the base image and the container in the output we can see "This is a custom container message for our Naveen Dasari Class")

--> For making sure we can also check by "docker ps" the container won't Run. But can see in the "docker ps-a". if we want we can simply start by taking the image.

Note: There is No need to give  -it while running in the CMD & ENTRYPOINT.
