Docker Push:

In order to push the code to Docker Hub, we have to create a public or pravite repository in the docker Account.

Also in the terminal we has login to the docker by below command:

--> docker login
--> docker logout

In order to tag our image and push that image into the docker HUb in the respository we created:

First tag the image with the Created repository that we want the image there:

--> docker tag <image name:version> <repository name that we created in the Docker hub account>
For Example: docker tag mine/centos:v1 naveendasari/mycentos

--> docker login --username= <user name of the Docker hub account> --email= <email of Docker hub account>
--> give the password that is prompted.

--> docker push <Repository name>
For Example: docker push naveendasari/mycentos
