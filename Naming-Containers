Naming Our Containers:

If we want to run a container by a specific name:

--> docker run -itd --name naveendasari ubuntu:latest /bin/bash (Here the container will be created by the name "naveendasari)

We can also rename even if the container is running & also not running.

--> docker rename laving_luue naveen505 (laving_luue is the current name, naveen505 is the name we want to change)

we can also rename by ID to name with the same command:

--> docker rename 5754467864 naveen ( 5754467864 is the current container ID, naveen is the name we changed too)
