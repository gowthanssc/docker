Controlling Port Exposure on containers:

Commands:

--> docker run -itd nginx:latest
--> docker ps ( we can see that Port 80, 443 are Exposed But If we check with Elinks It won't work)

In order to slove that It have to be Exposed one has to be mapped.

--> docker run -itd -p 80 nginx:latest (In docker ps we can see the Port is mapped with 32728) 

--> elinks http://localhost:32728 (we can see the nginx web page)

An another Example: 

--> docker run -itd -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
--> docker ps (we can see that tcp 80 will be Mapped with 8080)
--> elinks http://local host:8080

In the above cases only one port is mapping, In order to get all the ports exposed in the docker file from nginx latest. 

--> docker run -itd -P nginx:latest (In docker ps, here all the ports will be Mapped with other)

can check by using elinks as the same above procedure.

An Another Example:
If we want a particular address to be mapped we can do it by 

--> docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80 nginx:latest (In docker ps, we can check how its mapped)

--> elinks http://127.0.0.1:8081 (we can see the nginx page) 

Note: 127.0.0.1 is the IP Address of the Host, you can find it by ifconfig.
