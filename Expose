EXPOSE:

root @ # --> Mkdir Builds
	--> cd Builds
	--> mkdir ApacheInstallation
	--> cd ApacheInstallation
	-->Vim Dockerfile



	# This image is based on Centos 7 and will start apache service in each container

		FROM centos:latest
		MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com

		RUN yum update -y
		RUN yum install -y httpd net-tools

		RUN echo "This is a custom index file build during the image creation" > /var/www/html/index.html

		EXPOSE 80

		ENTRYPOINT apachectl "-DFOREGROUND"

--> docker build -t centos7:apache7:v1

What if we keep comment for the Expose 80. 

--> docker run -d --name apacheweb1 -p 8080:80 centos7/apache7:v1

It only runs in that particular port 8080. 

In order to Expose to run in the available port we will uncomment that and then run by using the below command.

--> docker run -d --name apacheweb2 -P centos7/apache7:v1

--> docker ps (it runs in the port 32728) 

So that we can check No meed to mention the particular port.

Note: Important command to grep IPADDress

--> docker inspect apacheweb1 | grep IPAdd (Displays the IP Address)
