ENTRY-POINT:

Entry point consists of the CMD, it takes an arguments, default application, or something else.

The main difference between Entry point and CMD is while running the dockerfile:

For Example:

For CMD: If we return in the docker file for echo " This is dasari page"
--> docker run centos7/echo:v1 /bin/echo "This is naveen page"

o/p : This is naveen page

i.e what ever we return in the docker file if we mention CMD echo message, and while running can change to the message we return.

For ENTRYPOINT: If we return in the docker file for echo " This is dasari page"
--> docker build -t centos7/entry:v1
--> docker run centos7/entry:v1 /bin/echo "This is naveen page"

o/p : This is dasari page

i.e what ever we return in the docker file will display even if we mention any thing also after echo.

For Example:

# Dockerfile based on the latest centos7 image - non -privileged user entry
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER naveendasari571@gmail.com

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user

ENTRYPOINT echo "This command will display this message on EVERY container that is run from it"

USER user


-->docker build -t centos7/entry:v1 .
--> docker run centos7/entry:v1
