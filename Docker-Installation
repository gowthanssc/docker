Install Docker in Centos 7 & 7.2:

Install docker in VM ware.

--> sudo yum search docker
--> cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
user@yum.repos.d --> sudo vim docker.repo

Paste the fallowing in the above docker.repo

[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Registry
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/$releasever/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg


--> Save that and update by using (sudo yum update)
--> clear
--> sudo yum install docker-engine
--> sudo systemctl enable docker
--> sudo systemctl start docker
--> sudo systemctl status docker
--> sudo docker images( Here we can't get images by default we have to get permissions)
--> docker run hello-world
--> sudo docker images (the hello-world image will be created)

So that --> cd /var/run/

user@run --> sudo usermod test -G docker
--> Exit and logout 

--> docker images (Now we get all those information of images & Info & can check version)


If you want to install Docker in Amazon Ec2-Instance fallow the link below, and don't forget to mention ALLTRAFFIC port range 0.0.0.0/0 for the security groups and check that the image is running or not in the PublicDNS. 

Please find the link : http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html#install_docker

There are some other commands that you must know:

--> df -h (Shows all the Memory information)

Want to know the container struture and information:

--> cd /var/lib/docker
container --> docker ps (can see all the container)
--> docker ps -a ( can see the running container)

If we want to see the images
--> cd image/
--> cd devicemapper/
--> cd imagedb/
--> cd sha256/ (can see the actual image)

--> docker images

Want to pull the image specifically 

--> docker pull ubuntu:xenial

Want to inspect & attach to that instance 

--> docker run -i -t ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
--> After attaching to that instance we can see the Memory,CPU, usage and everything use the below command: ps aux

--> exit

If we want to restart the image

--> docker restart nostagic_saha (Its Just an name of the image)

Want to inspect an image:

--> docker inspect ubuntu:xenial (Get information about the image)
--> docker attach nostalgic_saha (will be attahed to that instance)


Note: Might helpfull for the directory structure in Linux to view the conatainers in the VM Ware 

In order to see this we have to be in the Root.

VMWARE : cd /var/lib/docker/image/devicemapper/imagedb/sha256/ (we can see the container IDS)
EC2Instace : cd /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256 (we can see the container Ids) 

Note : 
--> To switch the users (sudo -i) 
--> i - inspect
--> t - attach
